## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

\- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building cool web apps, automating workflows, and contributing to open-source projects.

\- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about edge computing, Rust, and advanced AI prompt engineering.

\- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on developer tools, AI projects, and performance-first web frameworks.

\- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with optimizing CI/CD pipelines for monorepos and large-scale testing strategies.

\- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about full-stack development, shadcn/ui, translating tech docs (English â‡„ Burmese), or creating AI-first UIs.

\- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [[kagura@zkey.online](mailto\:kagura@zkey.online)]&#x20;

\- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: [Kim]

\- âš¡ Fun fact: I can code, translate, and build PRDsâ€”sometimes all before my second cup of coffee â˜•
